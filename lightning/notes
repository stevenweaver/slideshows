Who here in the audience has ever had an issue with reproducing a published result?

It's not an uncommon problem. According to a Nature news article, over 70% have had trouble with replicating research.

Now, software is not immune to this issue. Nearly 50% believed that code
availability was a critical roadblock to reproducible research.

Who here has given up trying to install and run software?

I have a few questions listed here that I've personally heard over the past two
weeks alone.

Journals are trying their best to remedy the issue, but recent efforts have
resulted in an expansive engineering effort that is both laborious to maintain and
has an undesirable user experience. Why? Because R and Python requires a hosted
backend solution in order to execute code.

So, why not use JavaScript?

* JavaScript is fast
* Performance is remarkably better in key benchmarks that pertain directly to bioinformatics

With code written in Phylotree, you will be able to

* Teach critical concepts with code that can be modified directly with interactive visualizations.
* Create notebooks that includes documentation, original data, and code used to generate results that can be modified immediately.
* All of this with no backend server necessary or environment configuration.
